Chasing the 10 Pound Monster

A coke a day. Tastes refreshing, instant smiles, a moment of complete happiness. However, science estimates every extra coke a day adds 15 pounds a year and other issues you canâ€™t see with each delicious sip. With more mental effort, one extra bottle of water, fruit for breakfast, vegetables with lunch, or several small 10 minutes walks a day can extend your life.

Knowing the difference between wants verses needs determines success in life. A want is a temporarily satisfaction. When you need something, simply moving toward that goal inspires or excites you. The fear of failure either motivates or challenges you. You can choose to do something that makes you feel good and with little risks but with life-changing consequence later. On the other hand, choose to do something that takes more mental effort and not so inspiring, but with life-changing rewards later. Ask yourself, will this small choice today limit my choices 1, 5, 10 years from now.
